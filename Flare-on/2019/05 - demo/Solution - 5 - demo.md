# Challenge 5 - demo

## Message
> Someone on the Flare team tried to impress us with their demoscene skills. It seems blank. See if you can figure it out or maybe we will have to fire them. No pressure.

## Provided Files
```
./5 - demo\4k.exe

## Methodology

The message for this challenge refers to ["demoscene"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demoscene); an "international computer art subculture focussed on producing demos: self-contained, 
sometimes extremely small, computer programs that produce audio-visual presentations". This hints at `4k.exe` being a demo executable; indicating we are likely
to encounter audio processing and/or graphical rendering functionality within the executable. It is also possible that we may encounter some form of executable packing, 
since a small size is one of the focusses of the demoscene.

We'll begin by simply executing `4k.exe` from a command prompt to see what kind of demo we are dealing with. Upon execution, a window pops up with a black background 
and a 3-dimensional rendering of the FLARE logo, rotating about the y-axis.
