# Challenge 7 - wopr

## Message
> We used our own computer hacking skills to "find" this AI on a military supercomputer. It does strongly resemble the classic 1983 movie WarGames. Perhaps life imitates art? If you can find the launch codes for us, we'll let you pass to the next challenge. We promise not to start a thermonuclear war.
